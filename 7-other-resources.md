Nothing we've seen in this repo is exhaustive, and you can go a lot deeper in a lot of areas. Here are a couple of sites I've found interesting.

1. General
- http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/reference.html - official docs. See in particular "Key Bindings" and "Keyboard Shortcuts - OSX".
- http://sublimetexttips.com/archives/ - this whole site is full of good stuff


2. Snippets
- http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/extensibility/snippets.html
- http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/sublime-code-snippets/


3. Packages

A short list of ones I like, but you can google for longer lists by more experienced devs.

- Text Pastry
- Emmet for anything HTML-related
- Case Conversion - gives you ability to convert to snake_case, camelCase, etc.

4. Stuff that we didn't cover

Either because we didn't have time or because I don't know about it...

- Shortcuts for the sidebar. I haven't found anything that makes it really easy to create, move, copy, delete files (the plugin AdvancedNewFile is the closest I've gotten)
- Shortcuts for splitting the screen into different layouts
- Terminal shortcuts
- Chrome shortcuts
- The wide world of find/replace/global find etc.
