The decision to make these files markdown was mostly just about choosing a neutral format that was easy-ish to read. While these files can serve as a quick reference, there are better reference lists out there on the internet.

The intention is not that you will read them as markdown, but that you will pull the files down, open them in Sublime, and practice as you read!
